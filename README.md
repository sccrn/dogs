## Dogs

In this project we're using Coordinators + MVVM and also:
- Alamofire (for our network's manager)
- RealmSwift (for our local database)
- SDWebImage (download and cache the images)
- IQKeyboardManagerSwift (for handle the keyboard)
- SVProgressHUD (our custom loading)

In the future, this project will have Unit Tests and something changes in the UI (for example, update the colors and improve the Home's screen design).

To install the dependencies:
```
pod install
```
